dartberrypi
===========

dartberrypi is an automated build script for cross-compiling the Dart SDK for 
the Raspberry Pi.  It produces a .deb package which is compatible with the
current version of Raspbian Linux for the Raspberry Pi.

This script is known to work with 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04.  For this reason, it is 
recommended to run this script within a virtual machine.  As always your
mileage may vary.

Unofficial Raspbian Dart SDK Package
====================================
An unofficial Dart SDK package for the Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) is available on
the [releases page](https://github.com/dlachausse/dartberrypi/releases).

WARNING: These are *unofficial* builds and are in no way supported by myself or
the Dart team in any way.
